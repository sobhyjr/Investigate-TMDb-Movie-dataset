# Investigate-TMDb-Movie-dataset
This is The Movie Database contains information about 10,000 movies. Here is a Jupyter Notebook to investigate the dataset. First things first,
I imported some libraries that I will use. I started Data Wrangling by importing data from 'tmdb-movies.csv' into a Dataframe, assessing, and cleaning the data.
After cleaning, I reached Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase in which exploring the dataset and answering the key questions by plotting diagrams using
Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization. Lastly wrote down a report to conclude and communicate my findings.
